OTUS Home Work 1.
1. Setup Cmake
2. Create deploy.sh script (my initiative)
3. Configure version {major.minor.build}. Build is provided via cmake presets.
4. Build binary that reports version {major.minor.build}
5. Build .deb package with that binary. (I do it via deploy script)
6. Adding tests (runs automatically during the build without necessety for additional script to run 'em all)
7. Applying workflow (GitHub)
